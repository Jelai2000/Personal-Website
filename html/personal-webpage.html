      and when in afternoon comes the go in the parish to attend another mass.

     <p>Now, I'm 13 years in serving the Lord and I'm greatful that I stay from the service 
      for the longtime despite of other responsibility in the past years and other commitment
      inside and outside of the church.
      
     </p>
     <p> 
     I already served with the bishop and other religous person not 
     only here in Rizal but with other places.

            <p>An altar server is a lay assistant to a member of the clergy
                during a Christian liturgy. An altar server attends to supporting tasks at the 
                altar such as fetching and carrying, ringing the altar bell, 
                helps bring up the gifts, brings up the book, among other things.
            </p>

            <p>By serving during church services or the Mass, children have so many hands-on 
                learning opportunities. It's a wonderful way for them to 
                learn the names of objects used during Mass, vestment pieces, and other 
                church-related terms.</p>

            <p>
                Name comes from the Latin word “ministrare” which means ‘’to serve’’. Their role is recognized by the Conciliar Constitution as an integral part of the 
                liturgic office, and as such demands conduct and behaviour from those who serve that is in keeping with it. Altar Servers must follow the example of Jesus, 
                who did not hesitate to place himself at the whole of humanity’s service, and even sacrificed himself. Not only during services, but also throughout everyday life, 
                Altar Servers must live by following His example of love, generosity, commitment and precision. 
                Altar Servers are Jesus’ ‘friends’, usually young people full of enthusiasm and willingness to take part in the activities of the 
                Church by offering their contributions of love and devotion.
